            <h3>Kardavus</h3>
            <p>
                Kardavus is a project for implementing many
                procedural generation techniques into creating a 
                simulated environment similar to the videogame Spore.
                Ultimately, the simulation will be able to demonstrate 
                the evolution of civilizations across the Kardashev 
                scale.

            <h3>Atomic Transistor Simulation</h3>
            <p>
                This simulation will be used to test different transistor
                structures and materials using analytical and numerical 
                analysis with fundamental physics such as quantum 
                mechanics and molecular dynamics. Ideally, this project 
                will be useful outside of transistor applications, 
                though the initial scope will be less broad.

            <h3>Our World</h3>
            <p>
                This composition is a series of several keyboard songs 
                that came to mind through observation of the world and 
                curiosity for the little details within it. Despite the 
                complex systems, views, and emotions that natural 
                phenomena can create, these songs seek to show these 
                simply.

            <h4>Strange Skies</h4>
            <p>
                The sky holds many secrets. Some days, it is completely 
                clear out, showing a vibrant blue seen nowhere else. 
                Other days, intense storms can be brutal to those outside, 
                but create peace for those who harbor indoors.

                The waves gently lap at the shore, each bringing new

                past creatures.
