            <h2 id="about-me-header">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Cyrus Kuhn, and I am a student at Bucknell
                University. During my time at Bucknell, I have had 
                countless opportunities to explore different fields 
                of study, partake in different activities, and meet 
                many completely different people. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My strongest value is that of respect of others, which 
                has been crucial in helping me form healthy relationships
                as well as establishing and reinforcing functioning 
                communities. Whenever I am given respect from someone 
                else, I simply feel good, and it allows me to work to 
                the best of my ability, even when problems outside of 
                the workplace are lurking behind. As such, I do my best 
                to treat everyone with respect, even if I am not always 
                treated the same way. The more people that you are kind 
                to, the more people you will find that are kind to you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We live in a world full of many hateful people, and it 
                can be easy to become angry and breed more hate. Love 
                one another. As someone with an older sister, there have 
                been some days where I did not like her. But no matter 
                what, I will always love her. There will be many people 
                throughout your journey who upset you. You do not have 
                to like them, but you do need to love them.

        <div class="research">
            <h2 id="research-header">Research</h2>
            <p>
                My research interests are rather widespread. Throughout 
                my life, I have had an intellectual fascination with 
                education, and much of my research has been about education 
                in a computer science setting. On the other hand, I am 
                fascinated with computers on the transistor and atomic 
                levels, and I am currently on a project researching different 
                structures for transistors that are more effective at 
                smaller sizes than are available today. I am also fascinated 
                by how systems work, and I would be excited to expand my 
                research portfolio into data structures and algorithms or 
                ASIC design.

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/cyrusKuhn/Kardavus">Kardavus</a></h3>
            <p>
                Kardavus is a project for implementing many
                procedural generation techniques into creating a 
                simulated environment similar to the videogame Spore.
                Ultimately, the simulation will be able to demonstrate 
                the evolution of civilizations across the Kardashev 
                scale.

            <h3>Atomic Transistor Simulation</h3>
            <p>
                This simulation will be used to test different transistor
                structures and materials using analytical and numerical 
                analysis with fundamental physics such as quantum 
                mechanics and molecular dynamics. Ideally, this project 
                will be useful outside of transistor applications, 
                though the initial scope will be less broad.

            <h3>Our World</h3>
            <p>
                This composition is a series of several keyboard songs 
                that came to mind through observation of the world and 
                curiosity for the little details within it. Despite the 
                complex systems, views, and emotions that natural 
                phenomena can create, these songs seek to show these 
                simply.

            <p>
                The sky holds many secrets. Some days, it is completely 
                clear out, showing a vibrant blue seen nowhere else. 
                Other days, intense storms can be brutal to those outside, 
                but create peace for those who harbor indoors.
