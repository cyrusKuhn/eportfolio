            <h3>Our World</h3>
            <p>
                This composition is a series of several keyboard songs 
                that came to mind through observation of the world and 
                curiosity for the little details within it. Despite the 
                complex systems, views, and emotions that natural 
                phenomena can create, these songs seek to show these 
                simply. 
            </p>

            <h4>Strange Skies</h4>
            <p>
                The sky holds many secrets. Some days, it is completely 
                clear out, showing a vibrant blue seen nowhere else. 
                Other days, intense storms can be brutal to those outside, 
                but create peace for those who harbor indoors. 
            </p>

            <h4>Sparse Seas</h4>
            <p>
                The waves gently lap at the shore, each bringing new 
                life to the beach and taking with it the shells of 
                past creatures. 
            </p>

            <h4>Spectacular Stars</h4>
            <p>
                Sometimes, there are no words for the sights available 
                to us. All that can be found is a gentle peace.
